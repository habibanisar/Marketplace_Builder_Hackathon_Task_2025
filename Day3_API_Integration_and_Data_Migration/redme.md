Day 3: API Integration and Data Migration Report - Bandage
📝 Objective
The primary goal for Day 3 was to integrate product data from an external API into Sanity CMS for the Bandage project. This integration automates the population of product details (images, titles, descriptions, prices, and tags), eliminating manual data entry and ensuring scalability. Additionally, data migration steps were implemented to back up and re-import data for testing purposes.

1. API Integration and Data Migration
API Data Fetching 🌍
Fetched product data from an external API, including:

🖼️ Images: URLs pointing to product images.

📝 Titles: Names or titles of the products.

📜 Descriptions: Brief details describing each product.

💲 Prices: Product prices.

🏷️ Tags: Keywords or categories defining the product.

Mapped the API data to corresponding fields in Sanity CMS to ensure proper storage and rendering.

Data Population in Sanity CMS 🔄
Dynamically populated fields in Sanity CMS with the fetched API data.

Benefits:

✅ Consistency: Uniform product details across the platform.

🔒 Accuracy: No manual errors in data entry.

📈 Scalability: Easily accommodates more products as the marketplace grows.

Data Migration 🔁
Used Sanity CLI to export the dataset from Sanity CMS as a backup.

Re-imported the dataset for testing to ensure data integrity.

Steps:

Exporting Data 💾: Exported existing data using Sanity CLI.

Verification of Data 🔍: Reviewed the exported JSON file to ensure correct structure and completeness.

Re-importing Data 🔄: Re-imported the dataset to confirm proper functionality and display on the frontend.

2. Tools Used 🛠️
Sanity Studio 🖥️: For creating schemas, managing content, and displaying product data.

Sanity CLI 🖱️: For exporting and importing datasets.

Sanity Vision 👁️: For previewing content within Sanity Studio.

Sanity Database 🗄️: For storing and managing dynamic content.

3. Conclusion 🎉
The integration of API data into Sanity CMS and the data migration process were successfully completed. The system now supports:

⚡ Automated Population: Product data is dynamically populated from the external API.

📊 Data Consistency: Uniform product details across the platform.

🔐 Data Integrity: Confirmed proper structure and display of data on the frontend.

This process significantly enhanced the scalability and efficiency of the content management system for the Bandage project.

4. Future Steps 🔮
To further enhance the system:

🔄 Automate Data Fetching: Periodically fetch and update product data from the external API.

📦 Inventory Management: Track product inventory and manage stock levels automatically.

📦 Order Tracking: Implement features for tracking customer orders.

🎨 UI/UX Improvements: Enhance the frontend design for a more user-friendly experience.
